    Andy Warhol is regarded as the "father of Pop Art" because of his new use of commonplace/things of little value (soup cans), also mass-produced imagery and items as works of art. By using images of celebrities (like Marilyn Monroe), consumer goods (like Campbell's Soup cans), and other icons from mass media, his work blurred the boundaries between high art and popular culture. Thus democratizing art in general. Through the use of well-known iconography, Warhol's method made art accessible to the general public while simultaneously celebrating and criticizing consumerism, celebrity, and mass manufacturing. His creative use of silkscreen printing also made it possible to duplicate images, which furthered themes of commercialization and repetition.

#Why the Banana?

 One of Andy Warhol's most famous works is his 1967 banana artwork. The Velvet Underground & Nico's LP cover was its first use. Warhol's fascination with commonplace items and popular culture was evident in this straightforward yet interesting image. An interactive aspect was added when the banana's peelable sticker revealed a pink fruit underneath. It became an icon of the Pop Art movement and the counterculture of the 1960s because of its playful nature and connection to The Velvet Underground. If someone didn't grasp the insanity and wildness of his work before, this would surely do the trick.
