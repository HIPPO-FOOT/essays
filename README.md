Andy Warhol is dubbed the "father of pop art" because he was the first to blur the distinction between art and culture. He used the imagery of pop culture—soup cans and stars—and created art that was true of the people by the people. Yet through silkscreen printing and repetitive visual engagement, he sought to take something so ridiculously impressionistic due to commercialization and ties to celebrities down to something merely consumer-oriented and obsessed with celebrities. Warhol's idea of art as social awareness of celebrity and the consumer experience and his works that rendered such distinction blended high and low art, making the difference irrelevant, and transforming the perception and reception of art. "In the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes." This quotation represents Warhol's notion of fame; it's fleeting. However, Warhol's influence on the art world changed his standing within the world as a cultural icon of the pop art generation. The 'father of pop art.' Andy Warhol is known as the 'father of pop art' because he created a union between art and popular culture that had both never been done before and never done again. When he took Campbell's soup cans or headshots of popular stars, he transformed them into creations that everyone could appreciate. His silkscreen printing, his repetitious imagery, and more screamed from the mountaintops of society's need for fame and consumerism. Warhol transformed the perception of art across the globe. He blurred the line between high and commercial art.

Andy Warhol is regarded as the "father of Pop Art" because of his new use of commonplace/things of little value (soup cans), also mass-produced imagery and items as works of art. By using images of celebrities (like Marilyn Monroe), consumer goods (like Campbell's Soup cans), and other icons from mass media, his work blurred the boundaries between high art and popular culture. Thus democratizing art in general. Through the use of well-known iconography, Warhol's method made art accessible to the general public while simultaneously celebrating and criticizing consumerism, celebrity, and mass manufacturing. His creative use of silkscreen printing also made it possible to duplicate images, which furthered themes of commercialization and repetition.

 One of Andy Warhol's most famous works is his 1967 banana artwork. The Velvet Underground & Nico's LP cover was its first use. Warhol's fascination with commonplace items and popular culture was evident in this straightforward yet interesting image. An interactive aspect was added when the banana's peelable sticker revealed a pink fruit underneath. It became an icon of the Pop Art movement and the counterculture of the 1960s because of its playful nature and connection to The Velvet Underground. If someone didn't grasp the insanity and wildness of his work before, this would surely do the trick.
